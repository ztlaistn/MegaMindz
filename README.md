# Meet N Greet
The pandemic has changed how people meet and talk to each other. Schools, jobs, and organizations had moved online and group calls became the new norm. Now, many people are seeing the benefits of virtual meetings- it can be more accessible, productive, and allows flexible work environments! However, other apps only allow only one user to talk at a time. 

Meet N Greet is a conferencing app that allows people to meet others and network online in a unique way. Attendees can explore the room and have group or one-on-one conversations at the same time. It aims to be useful for a conference, networking event, or education based setting.

It is a unique way for people to network online and aims to help facilitate meeting and connection!
