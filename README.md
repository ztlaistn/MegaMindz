Meet N Greet will be a gamified conferencing app. This will be web based since the primary focus is for users to join on their computers. 

We will fill in the niche that zoom lacks- allow users to meet others organically, and allow multiple conversations to occur. Zoom is the primary video conferencing app, but a main drawback is that only one user can talk at a time. Our app will allow users to navigate to other users in the room and have group or one on one conversations at the same time.
We will likely cater this to a conference or education based setting.
