Information about package.json file:

To run the app, you will have to pay attention to the "scripts" section.
So far, there is a dev script:
"dev": "nodemon --watch 'backend/**/*.js' -r esm backend/index.js"

To run this script, in the main megamindz directory, run:
npm run dev

----DEV SCRIPT EXPLAINED---

nodemon is used to monitor changes to the codebase,
so you don't have to manually restart the server everytime you make a change

It is set to watch any changes made to .js files in the backend folder

-r esm is VERY IMPORTANT
esm module loader helps us to use the es6 imports in node.js
By imports I am referring to the statements that look like this:

import { Server } from "./server";

We need the module functionality that ES6 provides to make our code more modular
AKA organize it into different pages, so it's more organized and prevents bugs!

Otherwise, we are forced to use require() statements rather than import
