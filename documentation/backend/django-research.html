    <h1>Django Research</h1>

    <h2>Rationale</h2>
    <p>
      We decided on Django as our backend framework for the following reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Most of our group members have experience developing in Python, so we thought a python based backend would be the best choice, rather than choosing a language that not everyone is familiar with, like TypeScript or Java.</li>
      <li>Django provides documentation and easy integration to deploy the app to Heroku. Since the course requires us to use Heroku for deployment, we thought Django would be a good fit.</li>
      <li>Python provides an easy interface for web sockets, which we plan to utilize in order to add voice calling to our app. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Add user account system</li>
      <li>Add support for voice chat using WebRTC api - django-</li>
    </ul>
