Seperation of Concerns:

1. Routes
  Responsible for which endpoints that certain tasks occur
  They should have no business logic and instead utilize the service layer
  Ex) /auth/login is an endpoint but it will have no logic that verifies password matches - it will utilize the AuthService

2. Services
  Responsible for business logic
  For testing, we need to ensure we are careful with dependecies.
  Look into: Dependency Injection and how it helps with testing
  Ex) AuthService.logIn will handle password match check

3. Models
  Responsible for interfacing with database
  Each function will connect to the database and make a query
  Can update, remove, or add database rows/cells
  Ex) TBD
